# Cosmos Token Factory Safety Guide

## Overview

In Cosmos blockchains, both token factory and CW20 token approaches have their place, and the safety considerations depend on your specific use case and network governance model.

## Token Factory Safety Considerations

The token factory module is generally safe for permissionless use from a technical standpoint - it's designed to handle arbitrary token creation without breaking consensus or creating security vulnerabilities. However, there are practical concerns:

### Potential Issues

- **Spam and bloat**: Unrestricted token creation can lead to blockchain state bloat and potential spam
- **Gas costs**: Most implementations require paying gas fees, which provides natural spam protection
- **Namespace pollution**: Can make token discovery and management more difficult
- **Regulatory considerations**: Depending on jurisdiction, unrestricted token creation might raise compliance questions

## Common Implementation Patterns

### 1. Permissionless with High Fees
Allow anyone to create tokens but set creation fees high enough to deter spam.

### 2. Governance-Gated
Require governance proposals for new token creation.

### 3. Whitelist Approach
Only allow specific addresses to create tokens.

### 4. Hybrid Model
Allow both token factory (for native tokens) and CW20 (for more complex tokens).

## CW20 vs Token Factory Trade-offs

### CW20 Tokens
- ✅ Offer more programmability and complex logic
- ❌ Require smart contract deployment

### Token Factory Tokens  
- ✅ Simpler and more gas-efficient
- ✅ Integrate better with native Cosmos modules like staking and governance
- ❌ Less programmable than CW20

## Recommended Approach

Most production networks use some form of restriction on token factory access through one of the following methods:

- High creation fees
- Governance requirements  
- Permissioned lists

Meanwhile, CW20 tokens remain available for more complex use cases that require additional programmability.

## Conclusion

The "right" approach depends on your network's goals around:
- **Decentralization**: How open should token creation be?
- **Spam prevention**: What level of protection is needed?
- **Token ecosystem management**: How should the token namespace be organized?

Consider your specific blockchain's requirements and governance model when deciding between permissionless and restricted token factory access.
